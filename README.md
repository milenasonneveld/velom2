**01 / A CARGO BIKE**
* Fastest way in an urban
environment
* Suited for city transit
* Green as can be
we chose
XYZ CARGO by Till Wolfer
and N55

**02 / AN ENERGY PLATFORM**
* Create power by pedaling
* Be energy independent
* Know what you consume
All knowledge is shared with other

**03 / MODULES**
* A cinema for open air screenings
* A help desk for public interventions 
* A fablab to make on the go
All plans and building instructions are free to use


The cargo bike is a great alternative for the car in congested cities; with our stackable modules we give sustainable initiatives endless possibilities. Vélo M² (pronounced Vélo em carree) is a multi modular capsule system fitting on cargo bikes. With our energy module supplied by solar and pedal power you can have the electricity on location to power an open-air cinema, a mobile fablab and much more on top. We bring all these plans to an open source platform and community where anybody can contribute. Cargo Bikes can be used for more then only transport, with Vélo M² we give the tools to rethink how we interact, move and use energy.
